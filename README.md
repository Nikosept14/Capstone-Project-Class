**Capstone Project â€“ Smart Home Energy Monitoring System**

-Designed and developed an ESP32-based device to monitor household power consumption (lighting and electrical appliances).

-Integrated current/voltage sensors with ESP32 and connected the data to Home Assistant via MQTT broker.

-Built an interactive dashboard in Home Assistant to display real-time power, voltage, current, and kWh usage.

-Implemented automated notifications when power consumption exceeded a defined threshold.
