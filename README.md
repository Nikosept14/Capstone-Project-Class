# Smart Home BMS Monitoring System

This project implements a **Control and Monitoring System for Battery Management System (BMS) with IoT integration in a Smart Home**. The system is designed to optimize renewable energy usage (PV/solar panel), monitor battery conditions in real-time, and improve household energy efficiency through the **Home Assistant** platform.

## üìå Key Features
- Real-time monitoring of voltage, current, and power using **INA219 sensors**
- **ESP32** microcontroller for data processing and IoT connectivity
- Data visualization on a **0.96" OLED display**
- **Home Assistant Dashboard (MQTT)** for control and monitoring
- Automatic **cut-off feature** to reduce unnecessary energy consumption
- **3D-printed smart home miniature prototype** for demonstration

## üîß Hardware Components
- Mini PV (5 Watt)
- MPPT (Maximum Power Point Tracking)
- BMS 3S (Battery Management System)
- Li-Ion 18650 Batteries
- ESP32 DevkitC V4
- INA219 (current & voltage sensor)
- 12V Relay Module
- 12V LED Lamp
- 12V Mini Fan
- 0.96" I2C OLED Display
- AWG Cables & Printed PCB

## üñ•Ô∏è Software Stack
- **VS Code + PlatformIO** for ESP32 development
- **Arduino Libraries** (Adafruit_INA219, Adafruit_SSD1306, ArduinoHA, WiFi, MQTT)
- **Home Assistant** for IoT dashboard control & monitoring
- **Onshape (CAD)** for mechanical & enclosure design

## ‚ö° System Architecture
1. Solar PV generates renewable electricity.
2. MPPT optimizes PV output power.
3. BMS 3S manages charging & discharging of Li-Ion batteries.
4. INA219 sensors measure voltage, current, and power.
5. ESP32 processes the data and sends it to Home Assistant via MQTT.
6. Data is displayed on both the OLED screen and the IoT dashboard.
7. Relay modules control household loads (LED lamps, fans).

## üìä Implementation Results
- Working prototype of a small-scale smart home with renewable energy integration
- Real-time monitoring of household energy consumption
- Device control via **Home Assistant dashboard**
- Improved energy efficiency with monitoring & automatic cut-off features
